			<p>This schematic shows 2 blue LEDs, 1 multi-colored LED, and a pushbutton lined up in a parallel circuit. The Arduino is powered by a 5V USB cord where 5 different PWM pins are used to individually connect to the LEDs, plus 1 regular GPIO pin connecting to the button. For the LEDs and the button, resistors with specific values were calculated and selected (see "Calculating Resistors" below) to avoid damaging components on the circuit. All the resistors were then connected to ground.</p> </div>

  <li><p>1 Arduino Uno R3</p></li>
  <li><p>1 breadboard</p></li>	
  <li><p>1 USB cable and power source (laptop)</p></li>

  <li><p>3 LEDs (2 blue; 1 multi-colored)</p></li>

		<h3 id="subheader">CALCULATING RESISTORS</h3> </br>
		<p>For <span style="color: green;font-weight:bold;">Green</span> and <span style="color: red;font-weight:bold;">Red</span> LEDs, — knowing that they have a 1.8 voltage drop and that the USB provides 5V, I calculated the 	
		voltage across the resistor as follows: </p>
		<p id="formula">V = 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V</p>
		<p>Using Ohm's Law, I then calculated the value of the resistors to achieve the desired current of 0.02A: </p>
		<p id="formula">voltage = current * resistance</p> 
		<p id="formula">3.2V    = 0.02A   * resistance </p> 
		<p id="formula">resistance = 3.2V / 0.02A = <span style="color: #8a8a8a;">160 Ω</span> </p>
		<p>Because the class kit provided does not include 160 Ω resistors, I <span style="color: #8a8a8a;font-weight:bold;">opted for a higher value of 220 Ω</span> which resulted in a lesser current but would prevent the LEDs from breaking. </p></br></br>

		<p>Using similar calculation for the <span style="color: #4287f5;font-weight:bold;">Blue</span> LEDs that have a 3.3 voltage drop, the voltage across the resistor would be </p>
		<p id="formula">V = 5V - 3.3V = 1.7 V </p>
		<p>Using Ohm's Law, </p>
		<p id="formula">voltage = current * resistance </p>
		<p id="formula">1.7V    = 0.02A   * resistance </p>
		<p id="formula">resistance = 1.7V / 0.02A = <span style="color: #8a8a8a;">85 Ω</span> </p>
		<p>Again, because the kit does not include 85 Ω resistors, I <span style="color: #8a8a8a;font-weight:bold;">used 100 Ω resistors for the 2 blue LEDs and a 220  Ω resistor for the blue LED in the multi-colored LED</span> for consistency, which didn't produce a noticeable difference in effect since any resistors with the value above 85 Ω should be fine.</p></br></br>

		<p>For the <span style="color: #ffffff;font-weight:bold;">button</span>, I <span style="color: #8a8a8a;font-weight:bold;">used a 10k Ω resistor</span> because  the 10k value limits the current to a lot less than that max current. For the button to work, we just need a nominal amount of current to flow, and the lower that amount is, the less power we will use.</p>
