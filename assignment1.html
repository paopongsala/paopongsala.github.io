		Identifying Values of Resistors </br>
		For Green, Red,and Yellow LEDs — knowing that they have a 1.8 voltage drop and that the USB provides 5V, I calculated the 	
		voltage as follows: </br>
		V = 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V </br>
		Using Ohm's Law, I then calculated the value of the resistors to achieve the desired current of 0.02A: </br>
		voltage = current * resistance </br>
		3.2V    = 0.02A   * resistance </br>
		resistance = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160 Ω </br>
		Because the class kit provided does not include 160 Ω resistors, I opted for a higher value of 220 Ω which resulted in 3.2V/220Ω = ~0.0145 A of current which is lower than the desired current but would prevent the LEDs from breaking. </br>

		Using similar calculation for the Blue and White LEDs that have a 3.3 voltage drop, the voltage is </br>
		V = 5V - 3.3V = 1.7 V </br>
		Using Ohm's Law, </br>
		voltage = current * resistance </br>
		1.7V    = 0.02A   * resistance </br>
		resistance = 1.7V / 0.02A = 85 Ω </br>
		Again, because the kit does not include 85 Ω resistors, I used 100 Ω resistors which resulted in a slightly lesser desired current of 1.7V/100Ω = 0.017 A.
